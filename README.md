# Find next page Improved

## A Firefox extension

This extension allows you to conveniently navigate to the next page when pressing Space at the end of the page. Forked from the [Find next page](https://gitlab.com/arty.name/firefox-extension-find-next-page) extension from Tom Adler. This improved version adds additional mechanisms to find the next page if not found via the `rel="next"` attribute:

* Via `page` url param or path
* Via other links in the page with a `page` url param or path
